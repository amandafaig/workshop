Github Workshop

A place for us to put our plans, our presentation slides, our practice files, etc.. for the workshop we're planning in the fall.

So far we've agreed on:

- Having a seperate workshop for each dept.
- Having the workshops in early Fall quarter (before people get bogged down).
- Having a theory aspect and a practical aspect
- Having the following practical exercises:

1. Make a repo from scratch, and adding your very first file to it.
2. Clone an existing repo, edit a file, and merge it properly (and make this a two person exercise.)
3. Go back to a previous commit and branch from that to make a second version of your code before merging.

We seem to agree that we should stick with working from a single repo, where all members are "contributers" rather than teaching how to fork and use pull requests.

What we need to decide/figure out/agree on:

- How much base knowledge we expect people to have.
- If working on a PC is very different than working on a MAC (working with github, that is).
- How we want to talk about branching: Is it best to avoid, except in certain cases?  Is it a good idea? We're not quite eye to eye on that yet.

'To Do' Item's we've identified so far:

- Make handouts/a presentation detailing each exercise and precisely what commands they will enter.
- Make handouts/a presentation explaining the theory.
- Practice the exercises to make sure they work well.
