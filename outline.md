So far we've agreed on:

- Having a seperate workshop for each dept.
- Having the workshops in early Fall quarter (before people get bogged down).
- Having a theory aspect and a practical aspect.
- Having a set of  practical exercises
- We want to teach workflow without branching, but maybe show scenarios where branching is really useful.

### Practical exercises 

1. Make a repo from scratch, and adding your very first file to it.
2. Clone an existing repo, edit a file, and merge it properly (and make this a two person exercise.)
3. Go back to a previous commit and just play around, but exit without committing.
4. Go back to a previous commit and actually save a second copy. (figure out how to do without branching OR decide this is how we wnat to introduce branching)
5. Branching?

### Overall philosophy 

We seem to agree that we should stick with working from a single repo, where all members are "contributers" rather than teaching how to fork and use pull requests.

### What we need to decide/figure out/agree on:

- How much base knowledge we expect people to have.
- > AgEcon: None!  Just how to open terminal and follow instructions.
- If working on a PC is very different than working on a MAC (working with github, that is).
- > Amanda will find out next week
- How much we want to talk about in the "theory" portion

### _To Do_ items we've identified so far:

- Start fleshing out the exercises.
- Make handouts/a presentation detailing each exercise and precisely what commands they will enter.
- Make handouts/a presentation explaining the theory.
- Practice the exercises to make sure they work well.
